# Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG

This repository contains the code and resources for constructing and evaluating advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The project explores different retrieval methods and evaluates their performance using feedback mechanisms like Answer Relevance, Context Relevance, and Groundedness.

## Features

- **Auto-Merging Retrieval:** Combines smaller chunks of information into larger, contextually rich segments to improve relevance and coherence in responses.
- **Sentence-Window Retrieval:** Focuses on retrieving smaller, contextually relevant chunks of text for precise and targeted information retrieval.
- **Evaluation with TruLens:** Utilizes TruLens to assess the quality of responses based on key metrics like Answer Relevance, Context Relevance, and Groundedness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Git
- [TruLens](https://github.com/trulens/trulens_eval) for evaluating LLM outputs.
- [OpenAI API Key] to access GPT models.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwiti6844/Building-and-Evaluating-Advanced-RAG.git
   cd Building-and-Evaluating-Advanced-RAG
Enjoy!
